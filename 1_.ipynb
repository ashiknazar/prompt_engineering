    "Prompts are cues or suggestions that stimulate ideas or responses. They can take various forms, such as questions, statements, or images, and are often used in writing, art, and conversation to inspire creativity or guide discussions. For example, a writing prompt might be a sentence that starts a story, while a conversation prompt could be a thought-provoking question to spark dialogue. Would you like some examples of prompts in a specific context?"

    "\n",
    "Fossil Fuels: Burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy releases large amounts of CO2.\n",

    "Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rising Temperatures: Global average temperatures have risen significantly over the last century.\n",
    "Melting Ice Caps: Glaciers and polar ice are melting, contributing to rising sea levels.\n",
